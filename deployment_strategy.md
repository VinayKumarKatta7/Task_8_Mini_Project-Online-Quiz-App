# Deployment Strategy: Real-Time PII Defense

## 1. Deployment Layer

*Sidecar Container in Kubernetes Pods*  
- The PII detector & redactor will run as a sidecar alongside each microservice that handles customer data.  
- All incoming/outgoing requests pass through this sidecar, ensuring real-time PII masking without modifying service code.

## 2. Architecture


- *Network-level protection:* Optional Layer 7 firewall for high-level filtering.  
- *Internal data streams:* All logs, message queues, and data pipelines pass through the PII redactor before storage.

## 3. Advantages

- *Scalability:* Sidecars scale automatically with pods.  
- *Low latency:* Local redaction avoids network round-trips to a central service.  
- *Cost-effective:* Minimal compute overhead per pod.  
- *Ease of integration:* No changes to existing microservice logic.

## 4. Monitoring & Logging

- Logs include anonymized metrics for monitoring PII redaction success.  
- Alerts generated if unredacted PII is detected in critical endpoints.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Add machine learning-based NER models for unstructured text detection.  
- Extend redaction to internal dashboards, internal web apps, and external logs.
